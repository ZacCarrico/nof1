## Rules to Follow

1. Write secure code using best practices.
1. Write a list of to-dos before making code changes.
1. Write or update tests for code changes. Fix the code to get the test to pass.
1. ALWAYS run gradle assemble/debug commands before saying the changes are complete, and then fix any bugs observed.
1. Git add after a code change.
1. Create a git commit message proposal that NEVER REFERENCES Claude Code. Check if this commit message should be used before committing with it.
